pattern :r'h'

sequence:hello world


both are strings 



alwaysn raw in pattern


how to write a pattern
a-z; 0-9

'a' can be pattern, this means whereever there is a there is a mathc
'ab' then ab is found then it is a match;'kebab'


we want to create a class(regular expression class)


pattern=r'\w'
\w matches alpha numerica characeters([0-9],[a-z],[A-Z])

so if you want a pattern which will take a or b or c
pattern=[abc]

all but abc

pattern=[^abc]


[abcd] is same as [a=d]




pattern =r'\W' same as '^\w'


'.' matches any characeters

'*' zero or more time repeated alpha numerica characeters


'+' one or more times 

# with this we are going to check whether the enterned email address is valid or not



abc@google.com

alpha numerica characeters @ alpha numerica characeters . alpha numerica characeters




@google.com does not work


'\w + @ \w +\.\w+'
